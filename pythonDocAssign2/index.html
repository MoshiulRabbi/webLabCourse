    <h3>Introduction to Python</h3>
    <p>
      Python is a cross-platform programming language, which means that it can
      run on multiple platforms like Windows, macOS, Linux, and has even been
      ported to the Java and .NET virtual machines. It is free and open-source.
    </p>
    <h3 class="textColor">Hello world !</h3>
    <p>
      We will start off with the traditional 'hello world' printing with Python
      <pre class="line-numbers">
        <code class="language-python">
           printf('Hello world !')
        </code>
     </pre>
     write this in your preferred IDE and hit the run button and the 'Hello World ' text should show up in your console
    </p>
    <h3 class="textColor" style="font:larger">Variables</h3>
    <h3 class="subtextcolor"> Creating Variables</h3>
    <p>
        Python has no command for declaring a variable.
        A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
        <br><br>
        <b>Example: </b>
        <pre class="line-numbers">
        <code class="language-python">
            x = 5
            y = "John"
            print(x)
            print(y)
         </code>
        </pre>

    Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, 
    and can even change type after they have been set.
    <pre class="line-numbers">
        <code class="language-python">
            x = 4       # x is of type int
            x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
            print(x))
         </code>
        </pre>
    </p>
    <h3 class="textColor">Python Data Types</h3>
    <p>
        Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. 
        It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be 
        performed on a particular data. Since everything is an object in Python 
        programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) 
        of these classes.
    </p>
    <p>Following are the standard or built-in data type of Python:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>
                <a href="#numeric">Numeric</a>

        <li>

                <a href="#sq">Sequence Type</a>
            </strong>
        </li>
        <li>

    <h4 id="numeric" class="subblock" style="text-align: 20px;">Numeric</h4>
    <p class="insubblock">In Python, numeric data type represent the data which has numeric value.
         Numeric value can be integer, floating number or even complex numbers. 
        These values are defined as int, float and complex class in Python.
    </p>
    <ul class="insubblock">
        <li>
            <strong>Integers</strong>
             This value is represented by int class. It contains positive or negative whole numbers (without fraction or decimal).
             In Python there is no limit to how long an integer value can be.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <strong>Float</strong>
            This value is represented by float class. It is a real number with floating point representation.
             It is specified by a decimal point. Optionally, the character e or E followed by a positive or 
             negative integer may be appended to specify scientific notation.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <pre class="insubblock">

    <p class="insubblock">In Python, sequence is the ordered collection of similar or different data types.
         Sequences allows to store multiple values in an organized and efficient fashion.
         There are several sequence types in Python.

         True or False. Boolean objects that are equal to True are truthy (true),
        and those equal to False are falsy (false). But non-Boolean objects can be evaluated
        in Boolean context as well and determined to be true or false.
        It is denoted by the class bool.

    <p class="insubblock">In Python, Set is an unordered collection of data
         type that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements.
         The order of elements in a set is undefined though it may consist of various elements.

    <ul class="insubblock">
        <li>
            <strong>Creating Sets</strong>
            Sets can be created by using the built-in set()
             function with an iterable object or a sequence by placing 
             the sequence inside curly braces, separated by comma. Type of elements
            in a set need not be the same, various mixed-up data type values can also be passed to the set.

    <p class="insubblock">Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values,
         used to store data values like a map, which unlike other Data Types that hold only
          single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair. Key-value is provided
           in the dictionary to make it more optimized. Each key-value pair in a Dictionary is 
           separated by a colon, whereas each key is separated by a comma.

    <ul class="insubblock">
        <li>
            <strong>Creating Dictionary</strong>
            In Python, a Dictionary can be created by placing a sequence of elements within curly {} braces,
             separated by comma. Values in a dictionary can be of any datatype and can be duplicated, whereas
              keys cant be repeated and must be immutable. Dictionary can also be created by the built-in function
               dict(). An empty dictionary can be created by just placing it to curly braces{}.

            In Python, all the statements indented by the same number of
            character spaces after a programming construct are considered
            to be part of a single block of code.
            Python uses indentation as its method of grouping statements.
